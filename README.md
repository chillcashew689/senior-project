This is a simple text-based, choose-your-own adventure video game that I wrote my senior year in highschool. I was very new to programming, so much so that I
only used if-else statements. I want to reprogram it from java to c++, now being able to implement classes and such. I am still nowhere near experienced, 
but I want to document my progress as a programmer and hopefully see how I've improved.
